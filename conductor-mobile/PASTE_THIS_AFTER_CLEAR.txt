We just completed Sprint 12 for the Conductor mobile app (Kotlin Multiplatform).

CURRENT STATE:
- Sprint 11 (shared code): ✅ Code review complete, 1 fix applied
- Sprint 12 (Android UI + Database): ✅ Code complete, ready for build testing

WHAT WAS BUILT TODAY:
1. Fixed MainActivity initialization (Sprint 11 issue)
2. Implemented Room/SQLite database layer (700 lines)
   - EventDao, ParticipantDao, CachedEventModel, AndroidEventCacheImpl
3. Built 3 UI screens (1,000+ lines)
   - EventListScreen: list of cached events
   - EventDetailScreen: timeline preview
   - QRScannerScreen: CameraX + ML Kit QR scanning
4. Implemented navigation system with deep linking
5. Updated Gradle config with kapt for Room compiler

APP FUNCTIONALITY (ready on Pixel 8):
- Launch → see event list (empty initially)
- Tap FAB → open QR scanner
- Scan QR → app decodes embedded event + saves to SQLite
- View timeline → all actions displayed with status
- Back → returns to list
- Restart → events persist in database
- Deep links (conductor://) work end-to-end

NEXT STEP:
User will test on Pixel 8:
1. Android Studio Gradle sync
2. Build APK
3. Install on Pixel 8
4. Run through test flow

IF YOU NEED TO WORK ON ANYTHING:
- All code is in: /H/Development/conductor/conductor/conductor-mobile/
- Main files: androidApp/src/main/kotlin/com/conductor/mobile/
- Database: shared/src/androidMain/kotlin/com/conductor/database/
- Documentation: SPRINT_12_IMPLEMENTATION.md, SPRINT_12_HANDOFF.md
