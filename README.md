   app.use(cors());
   app.use(bodyParser.json());
   
   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
     res.send('Conductor Server Running');
   });
   
   const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

## Development Tips
1. **Focus on one feature at a time:** Complete each step before moving to the next.
2. **Test frequently:** Verify each component works before building on top of it.
3. **Use version control:** Commit changes regularly to track progress.
4. **Document as you go:** Add comments and documentation while the code is fresh.
5. **Start simple:** Basic functionality first, then enhance progressively.

By following this step-by-step approach, you can build the Conductor app incrementally without feeling overwhelmed by the entire project scope.
