# Conductor - Get It On Your Phone

**Time needed: 5 minutes**

## Steps

1. **Start the server** (on your PC):
   ```
   devs\conductor\conductor-mobile\scripts\serve-apk.bat
   ```
   A QR code will appear in the terminal.

2. **Scan the QR** with your Pixel's camera

3. **Tap the link** → Download page opens

4. **Tap "Download APK"** → File downloads

5. **Open the downloaded file** → Android asks to install

6. **Tap "Install"** (you may need to allow "Install from unknown sources")

7. **Done!** Conductor is on your phone.

## First Test

After installing, we'll generate a test event QR for you to scan. Just say "ready for Conductor test" and I'll make one with timing that starts 2 minutes out.
