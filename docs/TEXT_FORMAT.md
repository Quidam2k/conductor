# Creating Events with a Text Editor

You can create Conductor events in any text editor — Notepad, VS Code, your phone's notes app, whatever. Save it as a `.txt` file and import it, or just paste the text directly into the input field.

## Quick Example

```
# Flash mob event — lines starting with # are comments
Title: Flash Mob at Central Park
Description: Meet by the fountain, east side
Start: 2026-03-15 2:00 PM
Timezone: America/New_York

0:00  Get ready
0:15  Wave left  [emphasis]
0:30  Wave right  [emphasis, countdown]
1:00  Jump!  [alert, countdown, haptic:triple]
1:30  Freeze in place
```

## Headers

Put these at the top of the file, one per line:

| Header | Required? | Example |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| `Title` | Yes | `Title: Flash Mob at Central Park` |
| `Start` | Yes | `Start: 2026-03-15 2:00 PM` |
| `Description` | No | `Description: Meet by the fountain` |
| `Timezone` | No | `Timezone: America/New_York` |

If you leave out `Timezone`, it defaults to your browser's local timezone.

**Start time is flexible** — all of these work:
- `2026-03-15 2:00 PM`
- `March 15, 2026 14:00`
- `2026-03-15T14:00`

## Timeline Actions

After the headers, add a blank line, then list your actions. Each line is a timestamp followed by **two or more spaces** (or a tab), then the action text:

```
M:SS  Action text here
```

For events longer than an hour, use `H:MM:SS`:

```
0:00    Opening remarks
0:30    Start moving
1:15:00 Final gathering
```

The timestamp is the offset from the event start time — `0:00` means "right when the event starts", `1:30` means "one minute and thirty seconds in."

## Tags (Optional)

Add `[tags]` at the end of any action line to customize how it looks and feels:

```
0:30  Wave right  [emphasis, countdown, haptic:triple]
```

| Tag | What it does |
|-----|-------------|
| `normal` | Default blue style |
| `emphasis` | Gold/highlighted style |
| `alert` | Red/urgent style |
| `countdown` | Announces "5, 4, 3, 2, 1" before the action |
| `haptic:single` | Single vibration pulse |
| `haptic:double` | Double vibration pulse (default) |
| `haptic:triple` | Triple vibration pulse |

Combine multiple tags with commas: `[alert, countdown, haptic:triple]`

## Comments and Blank Lines

- Lines starting with `#` are ignored (comments)
- Blank lines are ignored
- Lines that don't match any format are skipped with a warning

## Loading Your Event

Two ways to get your text event into Conductor:

1. **Paste it** — Copy the text, paste it into the "Got an event code?" field on the start screen, and tap **Load Event**
2. **Import a file** — Tap **Import Event File** and pick your `.txt` file

The app auto-detects the format. The same input field also accepts JSON events and compressed `v1_` event codes.

## Other Supported Formats

Besides the text format above, Conductor also accepts:

- **JSON** — Paste raw JSON with `title`, `startTime`, `timezone`, and `timeline` fields
- **Event codes** — The compressed `v1_` strings generated by the app's share features

All three formats work in the paste field, file import, and URL fragments.
