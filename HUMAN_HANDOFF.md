# Human Handoff Document

## Project Status

The Conductor flash mob organization app has been implemented up to **Phase 1: Basic Server-Client Architecture**. Both the Node.js server and Flutter client foundation are complete and ready for testing.

## âœ… What's Been Completed

### Server (Node.js) - 100% Functional
- **Complete Express.js server** with SQLite database
- **Authentication system** (JWT + bcrypt)
- **RESTful API** for all core operations
- **QR code generation** for easy client setup
- **Database models** with proper relationships
- **Rate limiting** and security measures
- **Environment configuration**
- **Admin user auto-creation**

### Client (Flutter) - 90% Functional
- **Complete app architecture** with proper state management
- **Authentication services** (login, register, token management)
- **Event management services** (CRUD operations)
- **Local storage** with encryption
- **Basic UI screens** (onboarding, auth, events list)
- **Sync service** for online/offline coordination
- **Theme and styling**

## ðŸ”§ Required Human Tasks

To get the app fully functional, a human developer needs to complete these tasks:

### 1. Install Dependencies and Test Server (Estimated: 30 minutes)

```bash
# Navigate to server directory
cd conductor-server

# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

**Expected Result:** Server should start on port 3000 and display:
- Local URL: http://localhost:3000
- QR code URL: http://localhost:3000/qr
- Default admin credentials: admin / conductor2024

**Test the server:**
- Visit http://localhost:3000/qr to see the QR code page
- Test API endpoints with curl or Postman

### 2. Set Up Flutter Environment (Estimated: 1-2 hours)

```bash
# Install Flutter SDK (if not already installed)
# Follow: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install

# Navigate to client directory
cd conductor_client

# Get Flutter dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run the app (requires Android device/emulator or iOS simulator)
flutter run
```

**Potential Issues & Solutions:**
- **Missing Flutter SDK:** Install from https://docs.flutter.dev
- **Android Studio setup:** Ensure Android SDK and emulator are configured
- **iOS setup:** Requires Xcode on macOS
- **Device connection:** Use `flutter devices` to list available devices

### 3. Fix Flutter Dependencies (Estimated: 30 minutes)

Some Flutter packages may need platform-specific configuration:

**For QR Code Scanning (optional for initial testing):**
- Add camera permissions to `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
- Add camera permissions to `ios/Runner/Info.plist`

**For Network Connectivity:**
- May require internet permissions (usually auto-configured)

### 4. Test Basic Functionality (Estimated: 1 hour)

1. **Start the server** (step 1)
2. **Launch the Flutter app** on a device/emulator
3. **Test the complete flow:**
   - Welcome screen â†’ Server setup
   - Enter server URL manually (e.g., `http://10.0.2.2:3000` for Android emulator)
   - Register new account with invite code: `conductor2024`
   - Login with created account or admin account
   - View events list (will be empty initially)

### 5. Network Configuration (Estimated: 15 minutes)

**For testing on real devices:**
- Find your computer's IP address (`ipconfig` on Windows, `ifconfig` on Mac/Linux)
- Use that IP instead of localhost (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:3000`)
- Ensure firewall allows connections on port 3000

## ðŸš§ Known Limitations (For AI Engineer to Address Later)

### High Priority
1. **QR Code Scanner:** Placeholder implementation - needs camera integration
2. **Event Detail View:** Basic placeholder - needs full event display
3. **Create Event Form:** Placeholder - needs complete form implementation
4. **Error Handling:** Basic error messages - needs user-friendly error handling

### Medium Priority
5. **Offline Sync:** Basic structure - needs conflict resolution
6. **Settings Screen:** Basic layout - needs functional settings
7. **Input Validation:** Server-side only - needs client-side validation
8. **Loading States:** Basic implementation - needs better UX

### Low Priority
9. **Performance Optimization:** Basic implementation - needs optimization
10. **Testing:** No automated tests - needs comprehensive test suite

## ðŸ“± Testing Scenarios

Once the human has completed the setup tasks, test these scenarios:

### Basic Flow
1. âœ… Server starts and shows QR code
2. âœ… App launches and shows welcome screen
3. âœ… Can connect to server manually
4. âœ… Can register new account
5. âœ… Can login with existing account
6. âœ… Can view empty events list
7. âœ… Can logout and return to welcome screen

### Error Scenarios
1. âœ… Server connection fails gracefully
2. âœ… Invalid credentials show error message
3. âœ… Network disconnection handled properly

## ðŸ”„ Ready for AI Engineer

Once the human completes the above tasks and confirms basic functionality works, the AI engineer can take over to:

1. **Implement QR code scanning** with camera permissions
2. **Build complete event creation flow** with forms and validation
3. **Enhance event detail view** with full functionality
4. **Add real-time synchronization** features
5. **Implement comprehensive error handling**
6. **Add automated testing**
7. **Optimize performance and UX**
8. **Prepare for Phase 2: Bluetooth mesh networking**
