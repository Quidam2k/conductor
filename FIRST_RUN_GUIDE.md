# Conductor - First Run Guide

Your AI assistants (Claude & Gemini) prepared this guide for your first experience.

---

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Start the APK Server
```bash
cd devs/conductor/conductor-mobile/scripts
.\serve-apk.bat
```
This starts a web server on your PC. You'll see your local IP address (like `192.168.1.x`).

### Step 2: Install on Your Pixel
1. On your phone, open Chrome
2. Go to `http://YOUR_PC_IP:8000`
3. Tap the APK link
4. Allow installation from unknown sources if prompted
5. Install takes ~10 seconds

### Step 3: Generate Fresh QR Code
```bash
python devs/conductor/test-data/generate-pantheon-qr.py
```
This creates `pantheon-inaugural-qr.png` with an event starting 2 minutes from now.

### Step 4: Launch & Scan
1. Open the Conductor app
2. Tap "Scan QR Code"
3. Point your camera at the QR code PNG on your monitor
4. The event loads instantly (no internet needed!)

### Step 5: Go Live
1. Review the timeline preview
2. Tap "Go Live" when ready
3. The circular timeline shows your progress
4. Listen for TTS announcements
5. Feel the haptic patterns

## What You'll Experience

**The Pantheon Inaugural** - A 90-second demonstration:

| Time | Action | Feedback |
|------|--------|----------|
| Start | "Take a deep breath. The Pantheon is online." | 🟣 Purple, single buzz |
| +20s | "Raise your phone like a torch." | 🟠 Orange, double buzz |
| +40s | "Look left, then right." | 🔵 Blue, single buzz |
| +60s | "Clap once. The signal has been sent." | 🟢 Green, triple buzz |
| +80s | "Final pose: arms crossed, slight nod." | 🩷 Pink, double buzz |

## Understanding the UI

### Event List Screen
- Shows all cached events
- Events persist even after app restart
- Swipe to delete

### Event Detail Screen
- Timeline preview with all actions
- "Practice" - Run at 2x-5x speed
- "Go Live" - Real-time with system alarms

### Coordination Screen (Circular Timeline)
- **Guitar Hero style** - Actions scroll toward center
- **Countdown beeps** - 5, 3, 2, 1...
- **Action announcement** - TTS reads the instruction
- **Haptic feedback** - Buzz pattern on action time
- **Progress indicator** - Shows where you are in the timeline

---

## Practice Mode

Want to test without waiting? Use Practice mode:
1. Open the event detail
2. Tap "Practice"
3. Choose speed (2x, 3x, 5x)
4. The whole event runs compressed

This lets you see the full experience in 20-45 seconds instead of 90.

## Troubleshooting

**QR code won't scan:**
- Make sure the PNG is displayed clearly (no reflections)
- Hold phone steady about 6 inches from screen
- Try increasing screen brightness

**No audio:**
- Check phone volume
- The app uses TTS (text-to-speech)
- Some actions may not have audio if TTS fails

**No haptics:**
- Make sure vibration is enabled in phone settings
- Some phones have vibration intensity settings

**Event shows "expired":**
- The QR encodes a specific start time
- Regenerate with the Python script for a fresh time

---

## What's Happening Under the Hood

1. **QR contains the entire event** - No server needed
2. **Data is gzip compressed** - Fits in ~600 character URL
3. **Deep linking** - `conductor://event/...` opens directly in app
4. **System alarms** - Even if you kill the app, notifications fire
5. **Offline-first** - Works in airplane mode after scanning

---

## Next Steps

After your first test:
- Try creating your own event (edit the JSON template)
- Test with alarms (let an event run in background)
- Share a QR code with someone else
